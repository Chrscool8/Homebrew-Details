<br>Trello Planning Here: [https://trello.com/b/C987oGK3/homebrew-details](https://trello.com/b/C987oGK3/homebrew-details)


**What is it?** <br>
This is an app that allows you to view details about, categorize, and manage all the .nro files on your Switch using [borealis](https://github.com/natinusala/borealis) for a native-feeling UI. It also includes a toolbox of handy quick actions like rebooting to a payload. It is nearly a feature-complete replacement/alternative for the official hbmenu.

**What's the current feature-set?**<br>
- Launch Apps
- Scan your SD card for homebrew programs (.nros)
- View details about your apps
- Sort the files into AppStore-acquired and local app categories
- Delete an app
- Reboot to a payload
- Check online for and download HD updates
- Themeable image assets
- Status info in the main page header (Date, time, battery level, charging status)
- Customizable Controls
- Use an installable forwarder nsp to access directly from the home menu
- Pin/Favorite Apps to the top of the list (Available now in debug mode)

**What will it be?**<br>
Hopefully, an all-around manager for all your apps. I'd like to add the ability to rename, move, and otherwise organize your nros. Some people have already expressed that they'd like it to be a full hbmenu replacement. With app launching, it's just about there already. Coming soon is blacklisting folders in the scan, checking for and updating app store apps, and more.

**Why does it exist?**<br>
Two main reasons: I've contributed some code to the official hbmenu, but I wanted to try making something totally original for practice working with Switch dev tools. Also, I wanted a new and modern way to do the above current and future features, but there wasn't really a centralized app with a pretty GUI that accomplished all of that.

**How can you try it?**<br>
You can find the full source and the compiled .nro on the Github releases page, or you can download the compiled .nro attached to the initial gbatemp discussion topic post and drop it into the /switch/ folder on your SD card! After you have the .nro, you can also download and install the .nsp to place a convenient icon on your home screen!

**What's next?** <br>
Things are already blazing along! I've already gotten a great lot of suggestions from the community, but feel free to chip in your ideas and desires! I'm working as fast as I can to make the best, most well-rounded project I can. There is also a [Trello planning board](https://trello.com/b/C987oGK3/homebrew-details) that is kept up to date with ideas and features in progress where you can vote on features you want to be higher priority.

**How can you help?**<br>
Comments, criticism, and suggestions are welcomed and encouraged. I'd love to make the greatest product I can for the community and I'm generally happy to cater to your specific requests when possible. All I ask of you is to enjoy using it. I'm making this in my free time, and if you'd like to monetarily support me to allow me to have more free time, you can find a sponsor/donation link on the GitHub page to toss me a buck, but that's not necessary and not expected of you. This project will always be free for all.

**Thank you for your time, I hope you enjoy it!**
