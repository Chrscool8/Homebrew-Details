This is mainly created as a practice project and so it would not be beneficial to have all the work done for me (so to speak), but I'm happy to work together with the community to create a better product for all of the public to use.

I welcome and encourage feedback, including comments, constructive criticism, suggestions, and requests, and although I can't guarantee acceptance, I will try my best to personally review any pull requests that you'd like to add to the project. Thanks!
